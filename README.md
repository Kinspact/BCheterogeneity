# BCheterogeneity
　This tool is used for the heterogeneity evaluation of the breast tissues based on the methylation 
of 2320 cell-type specific genes obtained from Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip dataset. We
further classified these samples into 9 subclusters according to their cell component and proportion.
