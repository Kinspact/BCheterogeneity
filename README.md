# BCheterogeneity
        This tool is used for the heterogeneity evaluation of the breast tissues based on the<br> 
methylation of 2320 cell-type specific genes obtained from Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip<br>
dataset. We further classified these samples into 9 subclusters according to their cell component<br>
and proportion.
