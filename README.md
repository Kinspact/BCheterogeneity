# BCheterogeneity
    This tool is used for the heterogeneity evaluation of the breast tissues based on the methylation of 2320 <br>
cell-type specific genes obtained from Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip dataset. We further classified these <br>
samples into 9 subclusters according to their cell component and proportion.
